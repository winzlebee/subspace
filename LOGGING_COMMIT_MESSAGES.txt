# Commit Message for Server Logging Improvements

## Single Commit:
```
feat(server): add comprehensive logging for operations and debugging

- Add INFO logging for auth events (register, login with user details)
- Add WARN logging for failed auth attempts
- Add INFO logging for WebSocket connections and disconnections
- Add DEBUG logging for all WebSocket message types
- Add INFO logging for critical operations (messages, voice, status updates)
- Add INFO logging for HTTP message creation and deletion
- Improve error logging with contextual information (user_id, channel_id, etc.)
- Add documentation for log levels and Docker usage

This significantly improves observability in Docker container logs, making it
easier to monitor user activity, troubleshoot issues, and audit system events.
