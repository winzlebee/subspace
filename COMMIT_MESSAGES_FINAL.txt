# Commit Messages

## For Reactivity Fixes:
```
fix: resolve UI reactivity issues with real-time updates

- Update dmConversations store when DM messages arrive via WebSocket
- Improve updateUserStatus to ensure proper Svelte reactivity
- Add missing dmConversations import to ws.ts
- Fixes status indicators, message previews, and other UI elements not updating without refresh

This resolves issues where UI elements wouldn't update until page refresh or
navigation, particularly affecting DM message previews and user status indicators.
```

## For Server Logging:
```
feat(server): add comprehensive logging for operations and debugging

- Add INFO logging for auth events (register, login with user details)
- Add WARN logging for failed auth attempts
- Add INFO logging for WebSocket connections and disconnections
- Add DEBUG logging for all WebSocket message types
- Add INFO logging for critical operations (messages, voice, status updates)
- Add INFO logging for HTTP message creation and deletion
- Improve error logging with contextual information (user_id, channel_id, etc.)

This significantly improves observability in Docker container logs, making it
easier to monitor user activity, troubleshoot issues, and audit system events.
Configurable via RUST_LOG environment variable.
```

## For Documentation Updates:
```
docs: add logging configuration and usage documentation

- Add logging section to README.md with configuration examples
- Add RUST_LOG environment variable documentation
- Add Docker log viewing commands and examples
- Document what gets logged and at which levels
- Add SERVER_LOGGING.md with comprehensive logging details
- Add REACTIVITY_FIXES.md explaining UI update improvements
- Update CHANGELOG.md with v0.10.0 changes

Provides clear guidance for server operators on monitoring and troubleshooting
their Subspace deployments.
