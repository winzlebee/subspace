fix(websocket): update DM conversation list on message events

Update dmConversations store when dm_message_created, dm_message_updated,
and dm_message_deleted events arrive. This ensures message previews in the
conversation list update in real-time without requiring page refresh.
```

### Commit 2:
```
fix(stores): improve user status update reactivity

Add early-return checks in updateUserStatus to avoid unnecessary updates
and ensure new array/object references are created for proper Svelte
reactivity. Fixes status indicators not updating in member lists and DM
conversations.
```

```
docs: add reactivity fixes documentation

Document the root cause of UI update issues and explain Svelte reactivity
patterns for future maintainers.
```
